# Finality recovery without sacrificing write throughput — review draft

Status: **approved review baseline; amended for a second architecture review;
not approved for implementation**. Source reviewed at `b7c497e` / 0.7.143 on
2026-09-07. Claude withdrew the per-slot rounds recommendation and accepted
protocol-faithful pipelined Simplex with separate views and ledger heights.
The membership candidate's proof pass is recorded in §4.3, including its
counterexample and unresolved carrier-rule interactions. Consensus, DTX and
signing-journal code still require review before commit. This commit is a plan
only: no code, format, release bump or fleet change.

## 1. Throughput is a design requirement

Yan's objective is increased **durably completed write throughput**. The
previous recommendation to replace the pipeline with sequential per-height
Tendermint is withdrawn. Merely disclosing a possible throughput regression
does not justify accepting it.

Preserving useful overlap is the default constraint. Removing it requires
a concrete replacement with demonstrated net-throughput improvement while
preserving latency and correctness. No such evidence exists today.

The approved baseline is restoring original Simplex's coherent progress/ancestry
rules within the existing owners, with §4.1's view/height separation. The baseline
choice is closed; its complete Quod adaptation is not yet proved. Review has
closed the view/height and per-view custody choices and accepted the carrier
and payload-window direction. The membership boundary and its interactions
in §4.3 still block implementation. Do not reopen a hybrid of Tendermint locks
and unchanged Simplex implicit finality.

Two obligations remain separate: repair permanent consensus stalls without
slowing healthy writes; then attribute and remove the per-write H1 cost.
Resolving a stall is not, by itself, a throughput measurement.

## 2. Established failure and evidence

The relay-readiness fix succeeded: preserved group
`3A8C2845311282594E39B33D4426297BFB70C760C2FF1F945442E2C920E1EE62`
completed without resubmission (source Decision 38, Complete 40).

A subsequent two-writer request stuck at `quod:route-a`: committed height
1787, notarized candidate 1788. All four validators have three support
signatures, two commit signatures and two complaints; quorum is three.
`3044d9b2` and `8fe423df` signed commit; `84fe4be5` and `96c49bc3`
signed complaint. These are votes, not committed ledger outcomes. Group:
`6FDDFDBA6A0D61C5E779593F08F5416F35ABCBE39FA7E2C8D20C1D2A6D231B6D`.

The permanent locks are unchanged:

1. `may_commit/2`, `may_complain/2` and the signing journal forbid opposite
   final votes, including the adjacent-slot implication.
2. Neither terminal certificate reaches quorum; re-delivery changes no vote.
3. Proposal/payload barriers prevent a successor over unfinished DTX;
   `noop` is not currently a proposable block.

Raw evidence: `/tmp/quod-h1-143-pair-smoke/results.tsv` reports client
30,047 ms and `pending`; 30,027 ms was an internal stage, not that wall time.
Preserve the group/journals during review. Do not resubmit, wipe or add load
to the stuck ontology. The split's cause in time is distinct from proving
that the current transitions cannot recover it.

## 3. Approved pipelined baseline and closed rounds debate

The reference is `doc/simplex_extended.pdf`, §§2.3–3.3. Notarization permits
advancement before direct finality. A complaint permits progress, not an
immediate durable empty entry. A committed descendant finalizes ancestors;
a parent's complaint does not itself prohibit committing its child. These
rules belong together; Quod cannot keep incompatible terminal-skip/cross-slot
rules and inherit the paper's liveness proof.

Under the reference, the observed notarized parent permits considering a
successor. Its complainers may commit that successor; a successful descendant
can finalize the parent without changing an old vote. This describes the
reference, NOT yet a completed DTX/membership adaptation.

| Direction | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Another complaint/grace exception | Reject: leaves the incompatible rules and cannot safely change the permanent locks. |
| Sequential per-height Tendermint | Withdrawn as recommendation: sacrifices overlap without a demonstrated compensating gain. |
| Restore protocol-faithful pipelined Simplex | Approved review baseline, including view/height separation. Finish the membership/era proof before implementation. |
| Per-height rounds plus current implicit child finality | Claude formally retracts this recommendation: the live split cannot form its round-change certificate; round-in-value bytes changes the locked identity; and multiple round candidates make unchanged slot-bound implicit finality unsound. Parent-value binding and coherent ancestry rules were the decisive reason to select spec-Simplex instead. Do not reintroduce the hybrid. |

Stable leaders and other throughput variants are not folded into this repair.
Evaluate them separately only if measurements justify their added scope and
fairness tradeoff. No second protocol or configurable compatibility mode.

### Recorded reasons for the retraction

- Three complaints cannot be collected from the reproduced two-complaint
  split. A chosen protocol must explain this exact schedule.
- In a per-height re-proposal protocol, a mutable round cannot change the
  locked value's bytes/timestamp. Original Simplex uses a different operation:
  a new view extends a parent. Do not mix the meanings of slot and round.
- Current `quod_catchup:verify_implicit` binds a child to the parent's slot.
  Allowing several supported values for that slot in different rounds breaks
  that uniqueness argument. A parent hash alone is not a cross-height lock
  proof. A restored Simplex mapping must preserve one supported value per view.
- One finalized value does not mean identical certificate bytes. Existing
  independent verification of equivalent signer subsets must remain.
- Leadership also lives in `quod_ingress_state` and placement correlations.
  Updating the vote state alone can leave accepted requests stranded.
- FLP does not establish an exhaustive list of engineering alternatives.

## 4. Reviewed decisions and remaining proof obligations

### 4.1 Views versus ledger heights

Today protocol positions, append indexes, ingress placement and DTX references
share slot numbers. Complaints must not manufacture irrevocable ledger entries
merely to keep those numbers equal.

**Closed by review.** Support/commit votes bind `(View, ValueHash)`, retaining
the existing signature-domain and vote-kind separation; a complaint binds its
view without asserting a block value. A block value is proposed in exactly one
view. A new view extends a parent; it never re-labels/re-signs the same block
bytes as a proposal in another view. Re-sending an existing signed proposal is
not a new proposal. Parent identity and view belong to the canonical block
grammar; append height is derived from the finalized ancestry.

The finalized ancestry appends at contiguous ledger heights. Failed views
produce neither fact changes nor synthetic terminal entries. A genuinely
committed empty carrier is a block and receives an append position, unlike a
view skipped by complaint evidence. DTX exact references bind **ledger heights,
not views**, retaining their exact-entry/hash/finality binding. A bare numeric
height is not a proof. No caller-supplied height/view alias may select an entry.

Once-only append follows unique notarization per view within a correctly
authorized committee era, plus an ancestry walk deduplicated by view identity
against the finalized prefix. A second descendant cannot re-apply an ancestor.
The existing codec, store and finalization path own this mapping; no second
ledger/index owner. §4.3 must establish unique era authority before this
within-era uniqueness argument can be used across reconfiguration.

The implementation audit must classify every affected `slot` use as protocol
view, append height or placement. This is not a local rename. Failed-view
evidence and parent material must remain sufficient for that same verifier's
forward ancestry walk, including after restart.

### 4.2 Application ordering versus consensus progress

DTX must still prevent later application work from assuming an uncommitted
Prepare/Decision/Finalize has been applied. That does not justify preventing
consensus from exchanging the evidence needed to finish the pending block.
Effects and facts remain released only through certified, ordered apply.

**Carrier direction closed by review.** There is one payload rule: an empty
payload is eligible exactly when the proposal extends an unfinalized parent;
non-empty admission retains its existing semantic checks. An empty carrier is
an ordinary block through the same proposal, votes, journal, verifier and append
path—not a DTX-only escape, unsigned marker or new certificate family.

**Explicit trigger:** entering a view whose selected parent is complete and
notarized-but-unfinalized wakes the existing proposal owner. Prefer an admissible
non-empty payload; if none can safely extend that parent, the same owner can
propose an empty carrier. The entering-view message/evidence edge is the trigger,
not a timer, polling loop or a later user request. Parent finality arriving
before an unsent carrier is selected removes that need; it must not cause a
second proposal after a support latch has already retained one. Idle finalized
ontologies do not create carrier traffic.

**Invariant replacing the control exclusion in `implicit_finality`:** every
honest validator's support of a barrier block already waits for that exact
block's deterministic validation verdict against the correct parent state.
A descendant can therefore carry its ancestor's finality without bypassing
that validation. Apply still walks the finalized ancestry once in order;
controls, facts, effects and custody are not released from support alone.
No `if DTX then bypass validation` branch, speculative Prolog apply or second
executor. Committee authority is the separate unresolved obligation in §4.3.

Direct healthy finality needs no carrier to prove the write. That is not a
promise of zero carrier traffic: the entering-view edge can race final votes
even on a healthy network. Preserve useful payload overlap, and count actual
carriers as cost, not useful writes. §4.3.3 records the precise empty-eligibility
and mandatory-membership-child interaction for the next review; historical
verification cannot depend on the receiver's current lack of a certificate.

### 4.3 Committee changes are the hardest boundary

Committees come from committed `peer_admitted` facts. A speculative child
cannot gain authority from an unfinalized membership change. A fresh verifier
must not use the new committee to check an old-committee descendant that
finalized that change.

#### 4.3.1 Review candidate

Let M change committee O to N. The proposed rule is: M's direct child C is
always an **old-era-signed empty carrier**; N activates from M's grandchild G
onward. Child/grandchild are ancestry relationships, not `view+1`/`view+2`:
complaints can create view gaps. The intended attraction is an ancestry-derived
boundary rather than activation according to local finality arrival order.
It would reuse the same carrier machinery when M or C is contested, including
disjoint committees, and the shared payload gate would reject a non-empty child
of an unfinalized M before support. It adds no membership-only recovery runner.

This candidate is **not approved**. The proof pass below refutes automatic
branch-local activation from a merely notarized C under the stated rules.

#### 4.3.2 Cross-era counterexample: notarization is not a handover

N=4, quorum 3, old committee O = {o1,o2,o3,oz}, new committee
N = {n1,n2,n3,n4}, disjoint. At most oz is Byzantine; the schedule is before
network synchrony. P is a finalized old-era parent. Notarization and complaint
certificates **can coexist**: the exclusion is commit-versus-complaint in one
view, not support-versus-complaint.

| View/branch | Support signers | Final-vote signers | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 10: M extends P, changes O to N | o1,o2,oz | o1,o2,o3 complain | M has a support QC and a complaint QC, no direct finality. |
| 11: C is M's empty old-era child | o1,o2,oz | o1,o2,o3 complain | C also has both QCs, no direct finality. |
| 12: X extends P, skipping 10/11 under their complaint QCs | o1,o2,o3 | o1,o2,o3 commit | O finalizes a chain omitting M and C. |
| 12: G extends C, under the proposed grandchild activation | n1,n2,n3 | n1,n2,n3 commit | N finalizes a chain including M and C. |

One admissible message ordering: delay M's support QC until o1/o2 have complained,
then give them that QC but withhold M's complaint QC so they can extend M with C.
Delay C's support QC until after their complaints too. Give N both support QCs;
give O the complaint QCs before it sees C's completed notarization. An old-era
leader that advanced via complaints has P as its selected parent and proposes X.
The new-era branch proposes G from C. Withholding/delaying honest broadcasts
before synchrony does not require an honest signer to equivocate.

Every shown QC has three distinct authorized signers under its branch-derived
era; no signer supports two values or both commits and complains in one view.
Nevertheless the two view-12 finality certificates conflict. The old/new voting
quorums need not intersect, and the new committee is using its own descendant
to retroactively authorize its introduction. Unique notarization per view in
one fixed committee does not resolve that circular authority.

This is an abstract schedule/quorum check of the candidate, not a reproduced
production failure or full model check. It is not the preserved 2/2 split:
those latched votes cannot later form a complaint QC. Testing only two stacked
2/2 splits can therefore pass while missing this cross-era safety failure.
Any purported rule that retires O irrevocably earlier must be stated with its
durable evidence and liveness proof; it is absent from the candidate as given.

Keeping every further contested carrier under O until an O commit would block
this particular self-authorization, but would no longer be the fixed-grandchild
rule and is **not silently adopted here**. A further architecture review must
provide a non-circular certified handover/era rule using the existing owner,
including its exact effect on append/verification and throughput. No joint
consensus, new lock, or extra protocol phase is implemented or presumed free.

#### 4.3.3 Carrier-rule interactions the review must settle

1. **Deterministic validity:** lack of locally observed parent finality cannot
   be a historical validity predicate. A carrier proposed before its parent
   finalizes can arrive at a validator or replayer after that parent finalizes.
   Shared validation must not reject the certified history on that account.
   Distinguish the reviewed *production eligibility* rule from a reproducible
   proposal/history-validity rule. Do not introduce two validators or silently
   change the accepted eligibility condition; the exact interpretation needs
   to be written and reviewed.
2. **Direct-finalized membership:** if M finalizes directly before its child is
   produced, “child always empty” and “empty only above an unfinalized parent”
   leave no eligible child. Skipping failed views does not help: the ancestry
   parent is still M. The candidate must cover this fault-free case as well
   as contested M and contested C; the same payload rule must reject the
   Byzantine non-empty-child attempt without a call-site exception.
3. **Contested M and contested C:** with the exact two 2/2 splits, reaching G
   must be possible under §4.4 and no vote may change. This is a liveness test,
   not a substitute for the cross-era safety schedule in §4.3.2.

The implementation remains blocked at this boundary. This does not reopen
the chosen pipelined baseline or authorize sequential per-height consensus.

### 4.4 The live window must permit the required progress

**Reviewed rule:** the depth bound governs payload-bearing advancement only.
Empty finality-carriers are exempt and may chain. This is a payload/protocol
distinction at one owner, not a second pipeline, new hard cap or cap increase.

Concrete counterexample to preserving Quod's global depth-one window: committed
head v-1; v is notarized with a latched 2-commit/2-complaint split. View v+1
becomes notarized with a fresh 2/2 split too. Both first-stage quorums exist;
neither final-vote camp reaches three. The current global allowance of two
uncommitted slots prevents v+2, so no later descendant can finalize either.
Removing the adjacent-view voting exclusion alone does not fix that deadlock.

With the reviewed rule, the next empty carrier and further necessary carriers
can proceed through the same view/proposal/signing machinery even while the
payload window is full. Once a descendant obtains commit finality, the existing
ancestry walk finalizes its ancestors, makes those entries durable once, and
prunes the collapsed live prefix while retaining journal floors and the
evidence/custody still required for serving and recovery.

**Paper attribution precision:** §5 of StableDispersedSimplex does describe a
k-style bound, but includes epoch-wide complaints and an end-of-epoch escape.
Its guarded advance also governs commit emission; it is not byte-for-byte
Quod's global `live_pipeline_slot` bound. The schedule above refutes the bound
transplanted onto basic per-view voting, not the complete published stable-
leader protocol. The carrier exemption is this plan's adaptation, to be tested
and proved, not a quotation of that paper's k rule. Stable-leader epochs are
not being introduced by this slice.

After synchrony and an eligible honest leader, the reference liveness argument
can collapse a **fixed-era** carrier chain, provided validity and dissemination
remain live. This is not a fixed bound on pre-synchrony memory/history, nor
proof that the currently open cross-era rule is safe/live. No arbitrary new
retention cap; pruning must preserve signing and availability obligations.

### 4.5 One routing projection and one signing owner

Project `(identity, era, view, leader)` from consensus into ordinary ingress
and retained DTX delivery. View changes invalidate obsolete placement and
wake existing owners, including unchanged live links and same-peer revisits.
Re-place identical retained signed submissions and operation/group identities.
A view advance is not proof of exclusion; only finalized history resolves it.
No new author sequence, client request or fabricated abort.

**Closed by review:** per-view support and final-vote latches, plus per-view
supported-body custody, generalize the existing atomic-retention pattern.
There is no Tendermint locked-value/locked-round state. In a fixed authorized
era, same-view exclusivity plus the ancestry rules establish safety. Committee
handover still needs §4.3's proof; “no locks” is not a substitute for that proof.

The signing journal remains the sole persist-before-exposure owner. Persist
the exact supported bytes and support latch atomically; persist the final
commit-or-complaint latch before exposure. Remove adjacent-view exclusions,
not same-view non-equivocation. **QSJ4 replaces QSJ3**, without compatibility.
Restart retains every outstanding view's required body/evidence and signing
floor. Reuse exact byte/parent/era-bound validation in existing candidate state,
not a new cache. Temporary evidence unavailability is not ordinary Prolog
failure. Proposer loss cannot strand required bytes.

### 4.6 Event-driven implementation

Proposal, validation completion, certificate, link and readiness messages
drive the existing state machine immediately. Reference failure detection
handles missing progress under stated synchrony assumptions. No polling,
success-path delay, retry ladder or additional watchdog protocol. A paper's
`wait until` maps to Erlang state transitions, not a polling loop.

## 5. Ownership and intended deletion map

These changes are conditional on closing section 4, not patches to apply now.

| Owner | Keep | Refactor/delete in the atomic cut |
|---|---|---|
| `quod_simplex` | one engine, useful pipeline, certificate pool, validation workers, ordered finalization | coherent view/ancestry progress; terminal complaint-to-skip, adjacent-slot voting exclusions, camp/grace repair machinery |
| `quod_signing_journal` | atomic supported-body/vote custody, DTX/content custody | per-view latches/custody in QSJ4; no Tendermint locks; remove adjacent-view exclusions |
| `quod_ingress_state` and relay custody | existing queues, signed submissions and authenticated delivery | one consensus-derived leader; duplicated leadership calculation and stale placement assumptions |
| `quod_ledger` and records | canonical bytes, store and codec ownership | view/append-position distinction; complaint-certified synthetic terminal entries |
| `quod_catchup` | one chain/era/certificate verifier | selected ancestry grammar replaces depth-one-only proof assumptions |
| `quod_foreign_log`, DTX references | one certified projection and exact-reference owner | same byte-bound grammar, no second evidence path |
| Prolog/apply/effects | existing authorization, deterministic truth and effects | preserve semantic fences; remove only fences proved to stop consensus unnecessarily |

Wholesale deletion of the pipeline/implicit finality is not approved. Fewer
conflicting rules, not fewer useful concurrent operations, is the objective.

## 6. Performance acceptance and independent H1 work

Count **unique durably completed user writes/s**, not acceptance responses,
votes, candidate blocks or progress-only empties. For a fixed workload:

`writes/s = useful writes per finalized block / mean finalized-block interval`.

Serialization increases that interval unless a measured saving offsets it.
Bigger batches can also increase waiting; they do not prove compensation.
Keep existing batching, with no new batch-fill delay or batching subsystem.

Compare identical hardware, N=4 topology, payloads, routes, ledger heights/
shapes, client distribution and offered load. Report repeated runs, unique
durable writes/s, failures/pending, mean/p50/p99 latency, writes/block, block
interval, queue wait, verification and journal-sync cost. Observe actual
child work overlapping parent finality; do not infer it from field names.

Required workloads: ordinary writes c=1/c=4 and saturation; an isolated last
write with no subsequent traffic; L1 certified readers; atomic two-writer and
A→B→C→D; membership and failed/delayed leaders. Keep fault and healthy results
separate, and count necessary progress-only blocks as cost, not useful writes.

Acceptance: fault recovery without ordinary-throughput regression beyond
measured run variation. A serialization alternative needs demonstrated NET
improvement. Preserve existing latency goals: one-hop c4 p99 <=450 ms and the
requested sub-500 ms remote-write objective. Neither is satisfied by a paper's
network-step count, a selected favorable run, or a freshly wiped ledger.

H1 remains separate and necessary:

1. `verify_resident_local_snapshot` opens a snapshot per exact reference.
   Measure repeated opens/checks inside a validation job before deciding what
   the existing owner can safely reuse.
2. `quod_ledger_store:locate/2` uses a sparse index: `skip_frames` performs at
   most 255 header preads, not a full-height scan. Compare reference count,
   position modulo 256, old-era fallback, storage and phase-index work.
3. Explain >=95% of the increase in MEAN latency from per-request sums/means.
   Distinguish `phase_suspend` and `phase_resume`; no marginal-quantile sums.

One lost overlap does not explain the earlier 11–17 s chains. Neither
algorithm restoration nor replacement proves that cost gone. H1 may continue
on unaffected fixtures; preserve the stuck group. Cold start, compaction and
carried small fixes stay separate. L2 remains gated; Yan's lane files untouched.

## 7. Review and implementation sequence

The sequencing agreed by Yan is binding because finality and H2 both touch
catch-up, ledger and phase-index seams, and the finality re-found destroys the
grown fixtures. This does not authorize any finality or H2 code now.

1. **Now, in parallel: H1 measurement and finality paper.** Finish H1's
   discriminator matrix on unaffected fixtures, retain raw outputs and deliver
   the >=95%-of-means attribution table, with `phase_suspend` separate from
   `phase_resume`. Label all these results **pre-cut 0.7.143**. Commit this
   amended plan and return it for architecture review: baseline selection and
   §4.1/§4.5 are closed; verify the §4.2/§4.4 mapping and settle §4.3's
   counterexample/carrier interactions. Model schedules without a second
   production path; no silently invented era-handover exception.
2. **Then, the finality arc.** Only after the architecture review is green and
   the H1 campaign has finished and its evidence is archived, make the atomic
   engine/journal/codec/finality/ingress/catch-up cut. Never combine new
   producers with old trust semantics. Delete superseded rules/comments/tests,
   with no compatibility switch. Run fault, restart and throughput gates and
   full sequential code gates; review precedes each consensus-area commit.
   Separately bump and perform the reviewed coordinated clean re-found, never
   a mixed-fleet rolling protocol. **No H1 run remains in flight at the cut or
   re-found.** The old fixtures must not be silently lost halfway through a run.
3. **Only after the finality cut and re-found: H2.** Re-grow fixtures on the
   new ledger and establish the post-cut baseline before implementation or
   conclusions about the height fix. Bring backend selection to review with
   the completed H1 attribution table, and revalidate its owner on the new
   protocol. Build H2 once against the final catch-up/ledger/phase-index seams,
   not once before the cut and again after it.

Keep pre-cut and post-cut datasets separate: do not pool them or subtract a
post-cut result from 0.7.143 to claim an H2 gain. The endorsed finality throughput
gate in §6 is unchanged; an H2 before/after comparison must use the same new
protocol and freshly grown, comparable fixtures. A re-found resetting height
is never evidence that the height-growth defect was fixed.

Current formats: QSJ3 journal, v1 block/entry grammar, `sx2` envelope.
The journal replacement is QSJ4. Select the remaining exact bumps after the
era/representation review; audit all embedded finality consumers. Do not bump
unrelated transaction/scope grammars without a field change. Foreign ingestion
remains wrapped with zero atom allocation.

A re-found DOES NOT recover the preserved old group. Keep it intact until that
re-found is scheduled; archive its evidence as **unresolved-on-the-old-network**
before retirement, never an uncommitted abort/success. Reproduce that fault on
the new protocol and prove completion there without resubmission. Planning
authorizes no fleet mutation. H1 continues only on unaffected fixtures.

## 8. Non-vacuous tests and gates

- Exact N=4 split, delayed/hidden evidence and a silent Byzantine member;
  completion without changing/double-counting an old vote.
- **Stacked double split:** notarized v and v+1 each latch 2 commit / 2
  complaint votes. An empty v+2 carrier and further necessary carriers remain
  admissible with the payload window full; one commit collapses the ancestry
  exactly once. The pre-change global depth-one rule must fail this schedule.
- Ordinary child work starts before parent finality; no test encoding forced
  sequential execution as the desired result.
- Complaint alone appends no terminal empty entry; eventual ancestry cannot
  contradict a previously published outcome.
- Gapped views, competing branches and equivalent witnesses: one final chain,
  contiguous append, exact references and no duplicate ancestor apply.
- DTX barrier completes without later user traffic and without premature
  facts/effects/custody release.
- Membership at the same split: disjoint committees, correct signing/activation
  era, removed-member rejection and fresh catch-up agreement.
- **Contested membership plus contested carrier:** M and C both notarize but
  neither final-vote camp reaches quorum. Recover without changing a latch,
  requiring another user request, or authorizing the new era circularly.
- **Byzantine non-empty membership child:** reject it at the shared payload
  admission/validation seam before support, through both live and recovered
  proposals, with no membership-only bypass elsewhere.
- The §4.3.2 support-plus-complaint-QC schedule cannot yield both old-branch X
  and new-branch G finality. Check same-view non-equivocation and signer sets
  explicitly; a test with only 2/2 splits does not cover this safety boundary.
- A directly finalized M still has a valid next step under the chosen payload/
  era rule. A valid carrier delayed until after parent finality still verifies
  at other validators and during history replay. Neither test may depend on
  the local arrival order of the same finality evidence.
- Crash around every durable vote/body/send; proposer loss, stale validation
  and live-link replacement; no double signing or lost work.
- Leader/view changes and same-peer revisits re-place retained bytes without
  fresh client requests or author sequences.
- Multiple failed views cannot hit an incidental window bound and deadlock;
  retained proof/body pruning preserves signing and availability obligations.
- Live and wrapped-history verification agree, reject wrong era/value/ancestry
  and allocate no foreign vocabulary.

Full implementation gates: compile, EUnit, `quod_ask_SUITE`, applicable
consensus/join suites, xref, dialyzer, diff-check, sequentially. No new consensus
gate exceptions. No implementation gates are claimed for this planning edit.

Diagnosis and the pipelined view/height baseline are accepted. The §4.3
candidate fails the stated ancestry-only activation proof pass; the amended
plan returns that explicit finding and the carrier interactions for review,
without adding a new protocol. The quorum witness was checked for signer
membership and same-view non-equivocation; no exhaustive model or production
test is claimed. The k-bound attribution in §4.4 distinguishes the published
stable-leader protocol from Quod's adaptation. No proposed throughput gain has
yet been measured, and the unchanged §6/H1 gate still applies.
